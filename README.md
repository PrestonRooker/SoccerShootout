# Soccer Shootout

Soccer Shootout is a 3D game where players must shoot penalty kicks against
ever-increasing odds. It is our final project for UCLA's CS 174A class. Check
out the game on [our webpage](https://prestonrooker.github.io/SoccerShootout)!

## How to play

Aim the ball and shoot when you're ready. Watch for the power circle - a bigger
circle means your shot will have more speed. Aim for the goal around the
defenders and obstacles. Score goals to rack up points! Miss more than 3 times
in a level and it's game over.
